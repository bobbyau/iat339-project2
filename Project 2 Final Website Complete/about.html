<h1>About Us</h1>
  <img class="about-image" src="images/about-image.jpg" width="1180" height="377" alt=""/>
  <p>Business opened operation in 1991. We have been a family owned business for more than 15 years an carry the finest hockey gear to our customers. Our customers drive our business success.</p>
  <p>Originally we had started selling hockey gear in garage and ship it to customers if they had ordered the products online. Finally, 3 years later in we had opened our own retail store due to the large demand and inventory that we had to bring in.</p>
  <p>Only the finest products end up in our retail store shelves and online to be sold to our customers.</p>
  <p>Our hockey experts are in our store to help customers to help find our customers what they want. If we donâ€™t have the size, color, or model then we could order them in.</p>
  <p>Try our demo stick room where our customers could demo hockey sticks and see which hockey stick is best suited for them before you leave Hockey Hub.</p>
  <p>We have all the tools ready to measure our customers and match them up with the gear they need based on size, budget, color, brand, etc.</p>
