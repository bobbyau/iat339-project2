  <h1>Hockey Sticks</h1>
  <a href="product-details-x90.html"><h2>Bauer Vapor X90 Hockey Stick</h2></a>
  <a href="product-details-x90.html"><img src="images/vapor-x90-01.png" width="300" height="300" alt=""/></a>
  <h3>$90</h3>
  <p>The Bauer Vapor X90 Grip Composite Stick comes in second in line to the throne.  With high-end features, you get quality without the king-sized price tag. The X90 is made from quality 12K carbon fiber throughout the shaft and a 3K carbon weave wrap in the blade, ultimately offering you a well-balanced and responsive feel. Also built into the X90 is Intelli-Sense Shot Technology, giving you better shots all around.</p>
  <a href="product-details-apx.html"><h2>Bauer Vapor APX Hockey Stick</h2></a>
  <a href="product-details-apx.html"><img src="images/apx-stick-01.png" width="350" height="300" alt=""/></a>
  <h3>$150</h3>
  <p>The revolution continues with the Bauer Vapor APX Composite Stick. From a new blade core that offers more feel with less weight, to a flex profile that changes based on what type of shot you're taking; the Bauer Vapor APX Composite Stick has been tuned to perform.</p>
  <a href="product-details-mx3.html"><h2>Bauer Supreme TotalOne MX3 Hockey Stick</h2></a>
  <a href="product-details-mx3.html"><img src="images/mx3-stick-01.png" width="320" height="300" alt=""/></a>
  <h3>$160</h3>
  <p>The terms Strength and Power have become synonymous with Bauer's Supreme stick line. That's because the line has been engineered to boost energy output. They have a mid-kick flex profile, which means a stiffer lower shaft and softer middle, allowing you to easily load the stick. You'll also find the Supreme power taper throughout the line, which further stiffens that bottom portion of the shaft in such a way that reduces the likelihood of twisting and torquing. These two forces combine for powerful and explosive shots that are also precise and controlled. If you liked the NXG, it is the predecessor to the Bauer Supreme TotalOne MX3, with the addition of improvements that reduce overall blade weight, improve stick balance and durability.</p>
  <a href="#"><h2>Easton V9/V9E</h2></a>
  <a href="#"><img src="images/easton-v9-01.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""/></a>
  <h3>$110</h3>
  <p>Easton did an excellent job with the Velocity series. The sticks feel great, perform like weâ€™ve come to expect from a top-end Easton, and feature improved durability. The difference is that one comes standard (V9-white), while the other an elliptical (V9E-orange).You see these two sticks are all over the NHL.</p>
